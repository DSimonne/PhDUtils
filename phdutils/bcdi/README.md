If you want to use the scripts for BCDI at ID01 or SIXS, you need to:
* Clone the repository.
* Make sure that the phdutils/bcdi/terminal_scripts folder is your PATH and PYTHONPATH
* Make sure that the first line of the scripts using the bcdi environment (#!/users/simonne/anaconda3/envs/rnice.BCDI/bin/python3 for me) is replaced by an up-to-date BCDI environment for you. Sadly you do not have the authorization to use mine =D
* You can install phdutils via the setup.py script, so that you can use via a package after in python
